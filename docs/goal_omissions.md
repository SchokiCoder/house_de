# v0.2.0 Commands / Keybinds

Keybinds are currently implemented via a switch on a char, so it's very simple.  
Number, modifier and multichar keybinds would make it a wholel ot more complex,  
so i decided to move that part of the update into the optional goals.  
Besides they are not that critical for now.  

# v0.3.0 sub-app stderr prints

I am not aware of a method to gather stdout, stderr and return code of a child
process, without stdout and stderr echoing.  
I have searched for it multiple hours.  
This still true for v1.0.0, so i move it into the optional goalset.
