# v0.2.0 Commands / Keybinds

Keybinds are currently implemented via a switch on a char, so it's very simple.  
Number, modifier and multichar keybinds would make it a wholel ot more complex,  
so i decided to move that part of the update into the optional goals.  
Besides they are not that critical for now.
