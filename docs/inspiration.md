# Inspiration

The very idea comes from Mr. House's operating system "UOS", from the Fallout
Universe.  

# Goal-changes

## 15.12.2022

With todays planned changes i think the creative freedom had been massively 
increased. (all hail the mighty title)  
I also got rid of planned features that, according to unix philosophy,
are unnecessary.  

### Multiplexing is dead

Unnecessary. It is already done by tmux and others.  
Unix philosophy, duh.  
How could i miss that?  
That's why proper planning **before** implementation is important.  
Now the app is going to be even smaller :D  

### Path is dead, long live title

Had been a neat usibility idea.  
After looking at my source of inspiration, i decided i wanted it to look more
like that.  
Afterall i took this project project way too serious before (planned way too
many things), so now i return to the original ideas.  
Paths could still be emulated by configuring the title of each menu
accordingly.  

## Horizontal lines are dead

Can still be achieved by configuring the title accordingly.  
**You cannot stop it, it's skill is limitless!**

## Optional full-sub-app-execution

Unnecessary but the partial implementation is not, so it is not outright
cancelled and i just made it optional.
