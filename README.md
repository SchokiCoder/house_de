# House User Interface

## What is this

A customizable terminal user-interface for common tasks and personal tastes,
inspired by suckless software.  
You can statically create TUI menus in config source code and then deploy it to
your user.  
Set it as their default shell, to chain them into specific tasks :D  
A scripting interface allows you to tack logic onto the menus.  
With it you can even create entire menus at runtime.
